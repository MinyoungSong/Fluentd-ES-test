# Elastic Curator

적용 버전 : 5.6.0

Elasticsearch Curator helps you curate, or manage, your Elasticsearch indices and snapshots by:

1. Obtaining the full list of indices (or snapshots) from the cluster, as the actionable list
2. Iterate through a list of user-defined filters to progressively remove indices (or snapshots) from this actionable list as needed.
3. Perform various actions on the items which remain in the actionable list.
